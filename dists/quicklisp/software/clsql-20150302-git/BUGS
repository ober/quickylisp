1. SBCL/Postgresql Interaction

Gabor Melis reported an interaction with SBCL and the postgresql
database backend using a multithreaded program and Portable
AllegroServe. It appears that libpg installs its own SIGPIPE
handler. When a multithreaded program servicing socket requests has
SIGPIPE conditions thrown, the running SBCL instance is killed.  The
web page http://linux.com.hk/docs/postgresql/libpq-threading.html has
more information about libpq's SIGPIPE handler.

2. Object joining

Aleksandar Bakic reported the documentation says that :home-key and
:foreign-key properties of the :db-info property may contain lists of
symbols. However, update-objects-joins fails in such cases.

2. configure file
Automatically generate makefiles based on the configuration of an
end-users system

3. SBCL/MySQL interaction Similar to the postgres interaction noted
above SBCL installs its own SIGPIPE handler but the mysql library
disables it breaking thread interrupts.  See also

for the conversation starting at 20:03:32 between bobbysmith007 and
pkhuong.

4. Thread safety issues. While clsql attempts to be threadsafe there
are some significant issues with some backends. See
doc/threading-warnings.txt for more info.
