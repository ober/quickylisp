CLSQL is a Common Lisp to SQL engine interface by Kevin M.
Rosenberg. It includes both functional and object oriented subsystems
for data definition and manipulation as well as an integrated symbolic
SQL syntax.

CLSQL supports a number of RDBMS and uses the UFFI (http://uffi.b9.com)
library for compatibility with Allegro CL, Lispworks, CMUCL, SBCL and
OpenMCL.

CLSQL has incorporated code from the following projects. At this point
in 2004, development of has stopped on these incorporated projects.
  - Pierre Mai's MaiSQL
  - onShore Development's UncommonSQL
  - Paul Meurer's SQL/ODBC
  - Cadabra's Oracle interface

CLSQL's home is http://clsql.b9.com.

Documentation is available as a PDF file in doc/clsql.pdf and as HTML
files in doc/html.tar.gz.


CONTRIBUTING
------------

If you would like to report a bug please do so through the clsql
mailing list. http://lists.b9.com/mailman/listinfo/CLSQL

Patches are welcome. It will be much easier for us to incorporate if
you use [git](http://git-scm.com/). Please keep distinct changes in
seperate patches as it makes it much easier to review. If you have
something small to to send to the mailing list `git format-patch` is
your friend.

If you have a bigger set of patches then I recommend creating a fork
on github from https://github.com/UnwashedMeme/clsql. Once your
patches are available there either issue a pull request or let us know
about it on the mailing list.

* http://help.github.com/ has some excellent tutorials on getting
