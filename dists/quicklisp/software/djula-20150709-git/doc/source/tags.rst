Tags
====

Overview
--------

Tags look like this: ``{% tag %}``. Tags are more complex than variables: Some
create text in the output, some control flow by performing loops or logic, and
some load external information into the template to be used by later variables.

Some tags require beginning and ending tags (i.e. ``{% tag %} ... tag contents
... {% endtag %}``).

Here are some of the more commonly used
tags:

:ttag:`for`
    Loop over each item in an array. For example, to display a list of athletes
    provided in ``athlete-list``::

        <ul>
        {% for athlete in athlete-list %}
            <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>

:ttag:`if`, ``else``
    Evaluates a variable, and if that variable is "true" the contents of the
    block are displayed::

        {% if athlete-list %}
            Number of athletes: {{ athlete-list|length }}
        {% else %}
            No athletes.
        {% endif %}

:ttag:`block` and :ttag:`extends`
    Set up `template inheritance`_ (see below), a powerful way
    of cutting down on "boilerplate" in templates.

List of tags
------------

.. contents:: Tags
   :local:

.. templatetag:: block
		 
block
^^^^^

Defines a block that can be overridden by child templates.

Sample usage::

  {% block stylesheets %}
     ...
  {% endblock %}
	  
See :ref:`Template inheritance` for more information.

.. templatetag:: extends
		 
extends
^^^^^^^

Extends a template

Sample usage::

  {% extends "base.html" %}

.. templatetag:: super  

super
^^^^^

Gets the content of the block from the parent template. You can pass the name of the block of the parent block you want to access. If no name is passed, then the current block's parent is used.

Sample usage::

     {% super "stylesheets" %}

     {% block stylesheets %}
       {% super %}
     {% endblock %}

.. templatetag:: comment     

comment
^^^^^^^

Ignores everything between ``{% comment %}`` and ``{% endcomment %}``.
An optional note may be inserted in the first tag. For example, this is
useful when commenting out code for documenting why the code was disabled.

Sample usage::

    <p>Rendered text with {{ pub-date|date }}</p>
    {% comment "Optional note" %}
        <p>Commented out text with {{ create-date|date }}</p>
    {% endcomment %}

``comment`` tags cannot be nested.

.. templatetag:: cycle

cycle
^^^^^

Produces one of its arguments each time this tag is encountered. The first
argument is produced on the first encounter, the second argument on the second
encounter, and so forth. Once all arguments are exhausted, the tag cycles to
the first argument and produces it again.

This tag is particularly useful in a loop::

    {% for o in some-list %}
        <tr class="{% cycle "row1" "row2" %}">
            ...
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}

The first iteration produces HTML that refers to class ``row1``, the second to
``row2``, the third to ``row1`` again, and so on for each iteration of the
loop.

You can use variables, too. For example, if you have two template variables,
``rowvalue1`` and ``rowvalue2``, you can alternate between their values like
this::

    {% for o in some-list %}
        <tr class="{% cycle rowvalue1 rowvalue2 %}">
            ...
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}

..
   Variables included in the cycle will be escaped.  You can disable auto-escaping
   with::

       {% for o in some-list %}
	   <tr class="{% autoescape off %}{% cycle rowvalue1 rowvalue2 %}{% endautoescape %}
	       ...
	   </tr>
       {% endfor %}

You can mix variables and strings::

    {% for o in some-list %}
        <tr class="{% cycle "row1" rowvalue2 "row3" %}">
            ...
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}


You can use any number of values in a ``cycle`` tag, separated by spaces.
Values enclosed in double quotes (``"``) are treated
as string literals, while values without quotes are treated as template
variables.

.. templatetag:: debug

debug
^^^^^

Outputs a whole load of debugging information

.. templatetag:: filter

filter
^^^^^^

Filters the contents of the block through one or more filters. Multiple
filters can be specified with pipes and filters can have arguments, just as
in variable syntax.

Note that the block includes *all* the text between the ``filter`` and
``endfilter`` tags.

Sample usage::

    {% filter force-escape|lower %}
        This text will be HTML-escaped, and will appear in all lowercase.
    {% endfilter %}

.. note::

    The :tfilter:`escape` and :tfilter:`safe` filters are not acceptable
    arguments. Instead, use the :ttag:`autoescape` tag to manage autoescaping
    for blocks of template code.

.. templatetag:: firstof

firstof
^^^^^^^

Outputs the first argument variable that is not ``False``. Outputs nothing if
all the passed variables are ``False``.

Sample usage::

    {% firstof var1 var2 var3 %}

You can also use a literal string as a fallback value in case all
passed variables are False::

    {% firstof var1 var2 var3 "fallback value" %}

..
   This tag auto-escapes variable values. You can disable auto-escaping with::

       {% autoescape off %}
	   {% firstof var1 var2 var3 "<strong>fallback value</strong>" %}
       {% endautoescape %}

   Or if only some variables should be escaped, you can use::

       {% firstof var1 var2|safe var3 "<strong>fallback value</strong>"|safe %}

.. templatetag:: for

for
^^^

Loops over each item in an array, making the item available in a context
variable. For example, to display a list of athletes provided in
``athlete-list``::

    <ul>
    {% for athlete in athlete-list %}
        <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

.. templatetag:: if

if
^^

The ``{% if %}`` tag evaluates a variable, and if that variable is "true" (i.e.
exists, is not empty, and is not a false boolean value) the contents of the
block are output::

    {% if athlete-list %}
        Number of athletes: {{ athlete-list|length }}
    {% else %}
        No athletes.
    {% endif %}

In the above, if ``athlete-list`` is not empty, the number of athletes will be
displayed by the ``{{ athlete-list|length }}`` variable.

Boolean operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ttag:`if` tags may use ``and``, ``or`` or ``not`` to test a number of
variables or to negate a given variable::

    {% if athlete-list and coach-list %}
        Both athletes and coaches are available.
    {% endif %}

    {% if not athlete-list %}
        There are no athletes.
    {% endif %}

    {% if athlete-list or coach-list %}
        There are some athletes or some coaches.
    {% endif %}

    {% if not athlete-list or coach-list %}
        There are no athletes or there are some coaches (OK, so
        writing English translations of boolean logic sounds
        stupid; it's not our fault).
    {% endif %}

    {% if athlete-list and not coach-list %}
        There are some athletes and absolutely no coaches.
    {% endif %}

Use of both ``and`` and ``or`` clauses within the same tag is allowed, with
``and`` having higher precedence than ``or`` e.g.::

    {% if athlete-list and coach-list or cheerleader-list %}

will be interpreted like:

.. code-block:: common-lisp

    (if (or (athlete-list and coach-list) cheerleader-list) ..)

Use of actual parentheses in the :ttag:`if` tag is invalid syntax. If you need
them to indicate precedence, you should use nested :ttag:`if` tags.

..
   :ttag:`if` tags may also use the operators ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>``,
   ``<=``, ``>=`` and ``in`` which work as follows:


   ``==`` operator
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Equality. Example::

       {% if somevar == "x" %}
	 This appears if variable somevar equals the string "x"
       {% endif %}

   ``!=`` operator
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Inequality. Example::

       {% if somevar != "x" %}
	 This appears if variable somevar does not equal the string "x",
	 or if somevar is not found in the context
       {% endif %}

   ``<`` operator
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Less than. Example::

       {% if somevar < 100 %}
	 This appears if variable somevar is less than 100.
       {% endif %}

   ``>`` operator
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Greater than. Example::

       {% if somevar > 0 %}
	 This appears if variable somevar is greater than 0.
       {% endif %}

   ``<=`` operator
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Less than or equal to. Example::

       {% if somevar <= 100 %}
	 This appears if variable somevar is less than 100 or equal to 100.
       {% endif %}

   ``>=`` operator
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Greater than or equal to. Example::

       {% if somevar >= 1 %}
	 This appears if variable somevar is greater than 1 or equal to 1.
       {% endif %}

   ``in`` operator
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Contained within. This operator is supported by many Python containers to test
   whether the given value is in the container. The following are some examples
   of how ``x in y`` will be interpreted::

       {% if "bc" in "abcdef" %}
	 This appears since "bc" is a substring of "abcdef"
       {% endif %}

       {% if "hello" in greetings %}
	 If greetings is a list or set, one element of which is the string
	 "hello", this will appear.
       {% endif %}

       {% if user in users %}
	 If users is a QuerySet, this will appear if user is an
	 instance that belongs to the QuerySet.
       {% endif %}

   ``not in`` operator
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Not contained within. This is the negation of the ``in`` operator.


   The comparison operators cannot be 'chained' like in Python or in mathematical
   notation. For example, instead of using::

       {% if a > b > c %}  (WRONG)

   you should use::

       {% if a > b and b > c %}

..
   Filters
   ^^^^^^^

   You can also use filters in the :ttag:`if` expression. For example::

       {% if messages|length >= 100 %}
	  You have lots of messages today!
       {% endif %}

.. templatetag:: ifchanged

ifchanged
^^^^^^^^^

Check if a value has changed from the last iteration of a loop.

The ``{% ifchanged %}`` block tag is used within a loop. 

If given one or more variables, check whether any variable has changed.

For example, the following shows the date every time it changes, while
showing the hour if either the hour or the date has changed::

        {% for date in days %}
            {% ifchanged date.date %} {{ date.date }} {% endifchanged %}
            {% ifchanged date.hour date.date %}
                {{ date.hour }}
            {% endifchanged %}
        {% endfor %}

The ``ifchanged`` tag can also take an optional ``{% else %}`` clause that
will be displayed if the value has not changed::

        {% for match in matches %}
            <div style="background-color:
                {% ifchanged match.ballot-id %}
                    {% cycle "red" "blue" %}
                {% else %}
                    gray
                {% endifchanged %}
            ">{{ match }}</div>
        {% endfor %}

.. templatetag:: ifequal

ifequal
^^^^^^^

Output the contents of the block if the two arguments equal each other.

Example::

    {% ifequal user.pk comment.user-id %}
        ...
    {% endifequal %}

As in the :ttag:`if` tag, an ``{% else %}`` clause is optional.

The arguments can be hard-coded strings, so the following is valid::

    {% ifequal user.username "adrian" %}
        ...
    {% endifequal %}

An alternative to the ``ifequal`` tag is to use the :ttag:`if` tag and the
``==`` operator.

.. templatetag:: ifnotequal

ifnotequal
^^^^^^^^^^

Just like :ttag:`ifequal`, except it tests that the two arguments are not
equal.

An alternative to the ``ifnotequal`` tag is to use the :ttag:`if` tag and
the ``!=`` operator.

.. templatetag:: include

include
^^^^^^^

Loads a template and renders it with the current context. This is a way of
"including" other templates within a template.

The template name can either be a variable or a hard-coded (quoted) string,
in either single or double quotes.

This example includes the contents of the template ``"foo/bar.html"``::

    {% include "foo/bar.html" %}

..
   .. templatetag:: load

   load
   ^^^^

   Loads a custom template tag set.

   For example, the following template would load all the tags and filters
   registered in ``somelibrary`` and ``otherlibrary`` located in package
   ``package``::

       {% load somelibrary package.otherlibrary %}

   You can also selectively load individual filters or tags from a library, using
   the ``from`` argument. In this example, the template tags/filters named ``foo``
   and ``bar`` will be loaded from ``somelibrary``::

       {% load foo bar from somelibrary %}

   See :doc:`Custom tag and filter libraries </howto/custom-template-tags>` for
   more information.

   .. templatetag:: lorem

   lorem
   ^^^^^

   .. versionadded:: 1.8

       The tag was previously located in :mod:`django.contrib.webdesign`.

   Displays random "lorem ipsum" Latin text. This is useful for providing sample
   data in templates.

   Usage::

       {% lorem [count] [method] [random] %}

   The ``{% lorem %}`` tag can be used with zero, one, two or three arguments.
   The arguments are:

   ===========  =============================================================
   Argument     Description
   ===========  =============================================================
   ``count``    A number (or variable) containing the number of paragraphs or
		words to generate (default is 1).
   ``method``   Either ``w`` for words, ``p`` for HTML paragraphs or ``b``
		for plain-text paragraph blocks (default is ``b``).
   ``random``   The word ``random``, which if given, does not use the common
		paragraph ("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...") when generating
		text.
   ===========  =============================================================

   Examples:

   * ``{% lorem %}`` will output the common "lorem ipsum" paragraph.
   * ``{% lorem 3 p %}`` will output the common "lorem ipsum" paragraph
     and two random paragraphs each wrapped in HTML ``<p>`` tags.
   * ``{% lorem 2 w random %}`` will output two random Latin words.

   .. templatetag:: now

   now
   ^^^

   Displays the current date and/or time, using a format according to the given
   string. Such string can contain format specifiers characters as described
   in the :tfilter:`date` filter section.

   Example::

       It is {% now "jS F Y H:i" %}

   Note that you can backslash-escape a format string if you want to use the
   "raw" value. In this example, "f" is backslash-escaped, because otherwise
   "f" is a format string that displays the time. The "o" doesn't need to be
   escaped, because it's not a format character::

       It is the {% now "jS o\f F" %}

   This would display as "It is the 4th of September".

   .. note::

       The format passed can also be one of the predefined ones
       :setting:`DATE_FORMAT`, :setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`,
       :setting:`SHORT_DATE_FORMAT` or :setting:`SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`.
       The predefined formats may vary depending on the current locale and
       if :ref:`format-localization` is enabled, e.g.::

	   It is {% now "SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT" %}
