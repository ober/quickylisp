fare-mop has a few simple utilities relying on the MOP.
It depends on CLOSER-MOP for portable MOP access.

The main utilities are:

SIMPLE-PRINT-OBJECT-MIXIN
	class mixin to give you a useful PRINT-OBJECT method for free

SIMPLE-PRINT-OBJECT
	a simple PRINT-OBJECT function you can use it without the mixin
        (useful when you don't want to change the class hierarchy of
        some library you're using, but still want to simply inspect objects
        and/or define a PRINT-OBJECT method on them).

COLLECT-SLOTS
	a utility used by the above function, to collect a p-list
        describing the slots bound in an object

SLOTS-TO-PRINT
	a way to customize which slots get printed by SIMPLE-PRINT-OBJECT-MIXIN


Other utilities include:        

REMAKE-OBJECT
	a utility for "copying" objects by calling make-instance with
        the "same" initialization arguments as an original objects,
        plus overriding keyword arguments.
        Useful for experimenting with a pure functional OO style.
        Not for use where performance is important.

See documentation strings for details.
